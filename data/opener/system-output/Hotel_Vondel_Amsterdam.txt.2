 The Hotel Vondel was in a nice quiet street. The Hotel lobby was lovely and our room was spacious and tidy. The restaurant served a really nice buffet breakfast and we really enjoyed our dinner their on our first night. 
The Hotel is quite close to trams and restaurants and bars that suited my husband and I. 
The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. 
The only bad thing was that our room was directly under the restaurant, and it became quite noisy at odd hours of the morning or night when the tables and chairs were being set up and moved around, or when there were a lot of people walking around above. Other than that it was a really nice hotel in a good spot. We'd stay there again for sure.
