 I chose this hotel because I needed a cheap stay in Amsterdam and I wasn't going to hang around in my room a lot. This hotel is perfect for that kind of use! The room was clean and tidy and the location was amazing! It's near the Leidseplein and from there you can get everywhere in Amsterdam. The service is also very good. The receptionist is friendly and helpful. And I slept really well here! The beds were soft and comfortable and there were no bugs.
