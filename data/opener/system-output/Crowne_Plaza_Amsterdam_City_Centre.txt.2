We loved this hotel. We stayed there for a week.
The hotel is centerally located, close to shops, cafes and a short walk to train station.
Our Quaint room had exposed beams,sloping roof and large windows.The room was large with a huge king size bed , comfortable lounge/sitting area ,an old world desk and wardrobe.The room also had an adjoining moderate sized bathroom that was well stocked with tioletries. 
Our room was also stocked with complimentry aromatherapy sleep preparations on arrival. The room also contained a Coffee maker maxchine that had an aray of different coffee flavours. This was restocked daily...at no extra cost to us.
Our room was very clean and well serviced twice daily.
Reception staff were helpfull , and had excellent customer relation skills .All of them spoke English well.
The hotel has free access to the internet in its bussiness centre located on a lower level. 3 machines.are available for guests use, and also a printer.
