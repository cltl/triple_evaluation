 My husband & I went away for 2 nights & found the hotel just a couple of mins walk from the nearest tram stop. The room we were given was tiny with the bed made of plywood shoved at the end of this tiny room with the bedding torn. The room was in the basement & it looked out to a brick wall with rubbish all over the ground. The buffet breakfast was ok, however the coffee was cold at 8am when we were 1st to arrive.Overall the hotel was ok for the money but would have expected a slightly better room than we were given.
