 Stayed in the hotel with our 2 month old baby for 2 nights. Staff were really friendly (including the trainee on reception) and helpful throughout the stay. We were checked in early on arrival and a cot bed was delivered to our room almost as soon as we got to our room. Conceirge were also really helpful. Room was lovely and well decorated. Great location, close to everything but not noisy. Would recommend and stay here again!
