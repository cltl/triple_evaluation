 The location is perfect, less than 5 mins walk from Leidseplein and from there you take tram 1,2 or 5 to the central station in 10-15 mins. The Hotel itself is a a nice, clean place and the staff is very friendly. But one minute after check-out time, the cleaner knocks on your door!! The bathroom is simple but clean and sufficient. Small stairs indeed, but do-able. In the end you only carry your luggage twice, so it's do-able. It is however an old building, so nearby closed doors and upstairs walking you will hear. But only three rooms shared our hallway, so not much people walked by. But for the money I paid, I did expect a bit more... But overall I didn't regret it and I would go here again (if they lower their prices a bit ;-)
