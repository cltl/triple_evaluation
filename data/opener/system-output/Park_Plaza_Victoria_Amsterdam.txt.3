 Just stayed here last week on my first trip to Amsterdam. Room was large but felt a bit dated - I don't think I had one of the recently remodeled rooms. Bathroom was a bit tired. Had a room on the first floor facing the Centraal Station - very convenient but a bit noisy - although that's not the hotel's fault. If the price is right, I think this is a great location - I didn't check out any of the property's amenities so I can't comment on that. Breakfast buffet was good - but pricey.
