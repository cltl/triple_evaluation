 The Vondel hotel is conveniently located in walking distance from all places in Amsterdam centre. It is in the old building, but it was recently renovated. Some furniture is ultra modern, like unusual shapes of water sink and shower.
However, the value for money is low. I paid approx. 110 Euro per night during my 3 days stay. The room was extremely small. The were two bunk bends (one above the other), a table slightly larger than A4 paper already full of hotel stuff. The space between the beds and the table and clothing cabinet was just enough to pass through.
Breakfast cost 19.95 Euro, which I rejected. I expect a decent dinner for this price, rather than breakfast.
