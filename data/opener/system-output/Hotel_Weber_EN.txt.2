 I stayed there for a night and here is my observation; Positive: Great Location/ Nicely decorated rooms/ Very well equipped for a B&B/ Basket of fresh bread in the morningNegative:Steep and long staircase therefore not recommended for senior citizens or those with knee problem/ No A/C so can be warm during summer time/ Since located in a very busy part of the city it can be noisy but they provide earplugs for you. Kamertip: Ask for the rooms facing the back street.
