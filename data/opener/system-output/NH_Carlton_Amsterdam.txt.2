 We enjoyed location of the hotel very much, it is the center of Amsterdam, near Flower market and Munt square. Stuff was very friendly and helpfull. You can rent bicycle at the hotel.
Hotel is close to Dam square and Rijks museum. 
To get the hotel take a train from the airport to central Amsterdam station for 4,30 euro. From central rail station take tram number 14, 16 or 9 to step out on 3-th stop named “Flower market”. Price for 1 tram ticket is 2,70 euro.
Brackfast was very good.
