 We booked in for an overnight stay in Amsterdam.The hotel is in a good location close to lots of the attractions. However that is the only positive thing I can say about this hotel. We were shown to our room which was in the basement of the hotel. It was a tiny room with 2 single beds pushed together. The room was dark and smelt of damp. Everytime someone used the toilet/shower/sink in the rooms above you could hear the water going through the pipes. The toilet didn't work proprly as the flush button kept getting stuck. The shower was just a drian in the corner and a shower curtain. Our room was close to the breakfast room and we were woken up at 7am by hotel workers and other guests getting their breakfast. It was so noisy that it was impossible to get back to sleep again. It was definately not worth the 90 euors we paid for the room, what a rip off. Thankfully we were only staying one night, if we had booked to stay longer we would definately have moved to another hotel!
