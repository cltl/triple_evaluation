 I stayed here for 1 night whilst on a business trip. The hotel is very central, which was good the next day for getting to our meetings but this meant that my room overlooked a couple of bars and the busy street and therefore the noise from the bar and the traffic was disturbing. I arrived around 9.45pm but by the time I had waited 15 minutes to check in it was gone 10pm when I got to my room. Room service finished at 10pm so I could get nothing to eat and I had to go back down to reception to buy a bottle of water from a vending machine. If I had been on holiday and travelling with someone else I wouldn't have minded going out to have a late dinner but when travelling for work I like to relax, order room service and get myself prepared for my early start the next day so this was very inconvenient.
There was free wifi at the hotel, which is always a plus when I am travelling for work, but the connection turned out to be very poor and I constantly had to keep logging back in so this was frustrating.
My room was fine - clean but quite dark. I had to scrabble around in the dark to plug in the brightest lamp in the room. I also spent 10 mins trying to find the proper blackout curtains behind the decorative, thin curtains. Once I had managed this, and as I had taken earplugs, I had a good night's sleep.
Breakfast the next morning was also fine. There was a good selection at the buffet although half the plates had been taken awat for refilling while I was there and I was in a hurry so did not have time to wait for them to come back from the kitchen.
It took me another 10 mins to check out that morning. Considering the size of the hotel, I was surprised there were only 2 staff on the reception desk to speed up the check in/check out processes.
All in all, I would not stay here again on a business trip. For a holiday, it would be fine, although still noisy. Unfortunately, the service provided was not up to the standards I require when travelling with work.
