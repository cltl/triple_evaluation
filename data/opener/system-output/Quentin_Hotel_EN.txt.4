 We stayed in a triple room at the Quentin Hotel in early August 2007. When we arrived the exterior of the place was covered in scaffolding and shade cloth and we had to duck under a metal pole to be able to climb the steep stairs to the reception. Our main reason for choosing to stay at this place was that it was listed in the Europe on a shoestring Lonely Planet Guide book, and it's seemingly reasonable price compared to other hotels in Amsterdam. But boy do you get what you pay for (in a bad way). We checked in and they wouldn't let me use my Travelex Cash Passport Card to pay, which is meant to be able to be used at any place that accepts Visa Credit cards. I was a bit suss about this since a few reviews on this site had warned about giving this place your credit card details. WARNING: If you are planning to pay by credit card they charge you a 5% surcharge. hmmph great! So when we were given our room key and we went to get in the lift to go upstairs the receptionist stopped us and said that she had forgotten to tell us that our room was actually in the basement of the hotel. We scaled the sticky stained red carpet that went downstairs with our luggage to see a room at the end of the corridor that looked like the janitors closet. When we managed to unjam open our door the stench hit us of extreme mould and g0d knows what else. The stained, sticky carpet stuck to your shoes with every step. Needing to go to the bathroom, my boyfriends stepped into the room, only just big enough to stand in, to find that it was wet on the walls and the floor. The ceiling was dark with mould and it became clear to us where that stench was coming from. There was no actual shower recess so when you showered (if you dared to) the whole bathroom would flood. The toilet made a noise like the world was coming to an end when you flushed it. The bed linen was stained with blood and other body fluids. The only window in the room which we opened to try improve the smell, opened into a courtyard where the hotel's dumpster was and the staff chained up their bicycles, which then opened onto the street. We went out and walked around the city for hours just to avoid having to stay in our room, but when we returned and none of us wanted to lay down on the bed to go to sleep, we decided that it was ridiculous that we were paying to stay a place like that. At 2am, we went up to reception to complain and see about cancelling our next 2 nights stay, and the guy on night duty at reception seemed to understand that room 002 was substandard to stay the least. He came and mopped the bathroom and gave us fresh towels and bed linen, apologising and promising to move us to a better room the next day. The room we were moved to was on the top floor (401), was a bit better, but they still didn't give us soap, towels or really clean the room at all the whole time we were there. The guy that checked us out seemed a little strange to say the least. If you HAVE to stay in a triple room in this place, make sure that you request 401 and NOT 002...but I would STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST STAYING HERE AT ALL.
