 This hotel I would stay at again if you want real basic sleeping at a low cost. The location is a bit hard to find and the booking a little bit confusing, but once sort yourself out it's very easy to get around with buses and a Metro 4 mins walk to the center. A nice view of a canal out side the window and the room very clean. My only concern was the stair being very steep for carrying luggage up. I rate this hotel a 3/5
