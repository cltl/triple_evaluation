 Average noisy business hotel, conveniently located near park, tram, train and RAI with very friendly staff. Absolutely clean, everything you need for business, but sleeping after 6:30 is a challenge, constant door slamming, coughing neighbours, suitcases rolling, elevator noise, idling busses. Fitness center is good, but for some reason there was no access to the sauna.
All-in-all: suitable for business, but not for exploring Amsterdam.
