 Located in the center of Amsterdam this hotel is within one minute walk from the station. The welcome staff is very nice. Arriving by car they will offload you luggage and bring it strait to your room. Then they will park your car for you. Check in is very smooth. The rooms are a little small for a Crown Plaza but itâ€™s very nice and clean with all the expected amities. The restaurant is also a bit small. The food is international so basically no problem; however in my opinion they should add a few more typical Dutch dishes. Bfast buffet is ok but needs to be improved. If you compare with other Crown Plaza Bfast buffet, this one is poor. The hotel staff is professional and the concierge will help you with whatever you need. He recommended two outside restaurant that were great. The main selling item for this hotel is definatey LOCATION.
