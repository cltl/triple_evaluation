 We arrived after an extended trip that included my exchange daughter from fourteen years ago's wedding in Germany. She had booked the hotel saying a friend had stayed here and loved it. She and her new husband came with me and my husband for the first part of their honeymoon.
When we arrived, the first thing that caught my eye was how filthy and run down the lobby was.I was afraid to sit on the couch. Not what I expected in a four star hotel. The unprofessional woman at the front desk told us we would have to wait while they got the rooms ready, despite this being at almost five pm. When we did go up to the rooms there was a mix-up and my husband and I were placed in the standard room although we had booked the "Executive Suite." I took one look around the tiny room with hideous decorations and said I could not stay. The woman at the desk recognized it was the wrong room category and said they only had one executive suite left and showed us a room below street level. I said that wasn't satisfactory. She said we could complain the next day when a manager would be in. This was on a Monday! After much more back and forth a manager finally showed up and got us into a better, although still ugly, room.How they could call this an executive suite I don't know. There was no free internet and not a real sitting area or desk. On top of this, we had requested flowers and champagne to be placed in our friends room as a honeymoon surprise and this had not happened.
After this horrendous beginning, things did improve. The people at the front desk from that point on were friendly and helpful. The sheets and towels were always clean and fresh and the mattress was comfortable.
Our room averaged 170 euro's per night. For that they did not provide breakfast. You had to pay an extra 20 euro's for their mediocre buffet. They did give us breakfast for free one day in compensation for the room mess up. You also had to pay extra for in room internet access. Our faucet in the sink only gave out warm water, never cold. The design of the sink was so poor it was ridiculous.
To be fair, I think I usually stay in a bit pricier hotels and I always use Trip Advisor. I held some responsibility for this poor choice by letting my young friend decide on the hotel. It was her honeymoon and the sad thing is I cannot imagine a less romantic place to spend it. Luckily, she went on to Paris and had a wonderful time!
