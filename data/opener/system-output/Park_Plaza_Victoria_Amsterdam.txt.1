 This hotel is great! We stayed in an NH hotel when we arrived the first time a month ago and it was expenssive (more than park plaza) and very very small rooms... TINY if you are 2 person in it. I assumed all hotels in amsterdam where simillar (overpriced and small) but happy to have found park plaza!
I was surprized that it is actually CHEAPER to stay here and also the room is 2 times bigger if not 2.5 times bigger.
We took the urban room and in the NH we stayed in a premium so it is fair to say that i can compare both for the $
Park plaza even has 2 flat screens in the room and they both have Internet on them and if you have your computer you get free wifi too! 
Breakfast was excellent and staff friendly.
Stay again? YES
Recomend? YES
Great value for money? YES YES
Even has a pool and it is located infron of the train station so when you get to the airport you get a train ticket for 6 - 7 euro instead of taxi for 65 euro :-)
So... in amsterdam i have seen many tiny overpriced hotels. This one is big and priced normally for what you get.
