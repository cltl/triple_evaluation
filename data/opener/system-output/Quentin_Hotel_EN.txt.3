 Stayed at the Quentin during the IBC convention. I meant to write a review about it when i returned - but time flew and here I am booking another IBC stay which reminded me of the horrible stay in 2006 at the Quentin. First treat was that they cut the rooms in half to get more rooms in the hotel. I barely fit in a double with my luggage.  Further, my neighbors were late nite prowlers who went at it loudly at all hours of the nite. Wouldn't have been so bad but the walls were so paper thin I could have sworn I was in the room with them (creepy). Second was the film of filth and dirty underpants in the hallway. Love seeing that first thing in the morning. Just plain gross. Third - you want to watch TV to drown out your neighbors? have to pay for the remote - note - it doesn't mean tthat the tv works (it probably doesnt - it didn't in 2 of the 3 rooms we rented). Fourth - what is that discusting smell? Is it sewage? There were so many moments of "oh my god this is discusting" that I can't list them. I can only warn people never to stay there. A youth hostel is a better bet. I will leave you with this... my room wasn't nearly as bad as my colleague who was stuck int he basement. They gave him a "single" which used to be a closet. They couldn't fit a full twin. The only saving grace was that he was next to the boiler room which took his mind off the fact that he was in a box. Last... they had the gall to charge additional if you paid with a credit card. what a dump.
