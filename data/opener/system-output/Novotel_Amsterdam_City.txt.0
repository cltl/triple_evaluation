 Short stay in Amsterdam, this hotel was very modern and breakfast which was included in price was excellent.. (Although bit of a queue to get a table).. Location excellent, 8 mins from Schipol airport only 7.60 euros for 3 of us on the train!!!!! Also the tram stops just across the way and takes about 10mins into the centre.... Quiet at night even though its a BIG hotel... Staff available everywhere in the hotel, and very knowledgeable about the city...
