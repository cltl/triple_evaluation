 The place isn't perfect and the rooms not luxurious, but it's a really good place. It is very clean. There's good room service daily. Even the corners and hidden areas show regular cleaning. Bearing in mind that it's very reasonably priced, it's hard to beat. The location is great just off Leidseplien on a quiet street next to a picturesque canal. The breakfast is basic but very good quality. The biggest problem is some of the rooms are tiny. I had tried to secure what I thought would be one of the largest rooms and was initially disappointed with the room they took me to. It wasn't possible to have both the suitcase open and sit in a chair at the same time and still have room to walk around. But, they showed me another room that was still cozy, but quite adequate. I stayed for 9 nights and really enjoyed it. The only criticism I have is they could update the quality of the chair in the room. I have to say they are really bad quality, just very cheap, discount fold-up chairs. Any level of up-grade would bea substantial improvement. Probably the best thing though is the quality of the people. They are just great and went out of their way to help a visitor in any way they could. Thanks Folks!
