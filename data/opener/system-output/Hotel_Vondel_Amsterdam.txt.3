 I stayed at Vondel hotel last year, in july. It has a very good location, at Leidseplein, near Marriott hotel . I had a double executive room, very nice, with a nice picture on the wall, great bad. Room was very clean and nice. What I didn't liked is that the walls are very thin, it is an old building and the floor was creaking.
Staff was very friendly , breakfast was very good, with many options, and you could have breakfast until 11 AM.
I would really recommend this hotel.
