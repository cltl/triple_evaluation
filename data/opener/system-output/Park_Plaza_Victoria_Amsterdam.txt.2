 Well that hotel was really good very close to every thing .its close to damrak square , Madame Tassuds museum 
The hotel is facing the train station and also very close to a very long shopping street with every thing you would need , and not so far from Red light district ,, Employees at the reception are helpful and friendly , room was clean and nice looking with free internet connection ( a bit slow connection ,,it's ok for browsing but forget about youtube for ex.)
i didn't eat at the hotel i had no time for this ;) Me and my wife really enjoyed our stay there ! and would choose it again if i'm back to Amsterdam btw it's a great city ....
