 A great base for a stay in Amsterdam. Definitely feels like having your own place to stay with the advantages of both a hotel (they come clean and make the bed etc, yay) with self catering. Location is good, just far enough away from the centre. It's a pleasant 15 minutes walk into De Dam, either along the canals or down a great shopping street. And round the corner from Leidesplein. I stayed in the first floor front room (with the balcony, which was great) and didn't have any problems with the noise from the bar others have mentioned after I used the earplugs. The only thing that I felt let the place down was, as someone else mentioned, the towels. I know it sounds petty but this place has been extensively refurbished, and is not a budget option anymore with the average price being around 100 euros a night but the towels are straight out of a hostel. Thin, cheap things that turn into rags as soon as they're damp. A shame.
