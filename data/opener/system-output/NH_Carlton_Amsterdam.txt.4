 I stayed in the hotel last year and I just thought about giving it a review.
I recall when I checked in the hotel, the staff asked me if I woud like to have an upgrade for some extra charge but I didn't want it. The room I got was quite small which didn't bother me. But later at night I realized it was right next to the elevator, I could hear the elevator motor noise all night because apparently the hotel guests were partying all night long and came back to the hotel at all hours.
I had horrible sleep for the first 2 nights and finally complained to the staffs, they switched me to an upgraded room for fee for the 3rd night. The new room was much larger and nicer. Perhaps I should upgraded my room when I checked in.
Other than the noise issues, the hotel is in a very good location next to the flowers market and many restaurants and bars.
