 I booked 2 nights during a weekend. The hotel is perfectly located just a few steps from Rembrandtplein and its Restaurants/Bars/Coffeeshops, and also from Amsterdam Centraal.There is also a great bar just next door which is pretty cool when you fancy one last drink when you get back to the hotel.The hotel was quite clean (except the carpets). At least the bathroom and bed are perfectly clean.If you can, avoid staying on first floor (to avoid lots of noise from the hotel entrance : door banging, drunk english teenagers coming back drunk and loud, cleaners talking very loud in the corridor in the morning).And if you combine 1st floor + street view, you will just not be able to sleep, unless you are really drunk :-p Overall I got what I paid for, but next time i would adjust a bit my booking and ask for a quiet room.
