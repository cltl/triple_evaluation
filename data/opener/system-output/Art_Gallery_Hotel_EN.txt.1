 As with most hotels in Amsterdam, there are a lot of stairs. (I was on the second floor.) The rooms are small but comfortable. The people at reception were friendly. The best part of the hotelis its location--five minutes from Leidse Square or the Rijksmuseum. Breakfasts were more ample than one expects in an Amsterdam hotel.
