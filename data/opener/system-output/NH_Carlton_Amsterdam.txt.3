 This hotel is in the centre of Amsterdam overlooking the flowermarket and is perfect for getting around easily . Our room was looking out onto one of the main roads with a great view , the hotel was quiet and we were not kept awake by the traffic outside . The bedroom was spacious and immaculate ,nice bathroom with good shower & plenty of hot water. We did not eat in the hotel but used the cafe/bar and the staff were really helpfull will definately use this hotel again when we return. Everything was within walking distance we did get a 3 day tram ticket really good value lets u hop on & off as often as u like .We also did a nite time 2 and a half hour canal cruise including 4 course dinner & drinks it was great.... and a trip round the city by horse drawn carriage which was worth every penny that was for 2 hours as well...................
