 This was our first Novotel, and we thought it was great. Nothing spectacular, but quite good. Parking is right out front (which isn't always the case for European hotels), which is a big bonus. The room was great for our family of three, and our daughter's breakfast was free. Breakfast was also a pretty impressive spread. It's not right downtown, but it's very close to a tram station, and the tram will take you straight to the main train station, so it was quite convenient. We were amazed at how many languages they spoke there. The breakfast manager alone spoke 5 or 6 languages.
