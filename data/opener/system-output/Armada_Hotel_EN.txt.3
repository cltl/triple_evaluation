 No Aircondition and it was damn hot under the roof!The person in change were very friendly!The rooms were a little too dirty: hair in the towels,...The bathrooms were very old standard, trouble with the water in the "shower".No possibility to close the shower cabin, so the bathroom got very wet!No parking lot! You have to look for a parking space at the grachts!The TV doesn't work very well and there was no remote control for it!Free Wi-Fi is offered and available in the rooms!Anyway if you look for a hotel with a good location close to the center of Amsterdam, just for sleeping, it is ok!
