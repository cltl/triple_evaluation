I booked into this hotel for a short business trip to Amsterdam because I remembered having stayed there some ten years previously and had enjoyed using the hotel gym/health centre on that visit.
This time I was visiting a company in Zaandam - a twenty minute train ride from Amsterdam Central. There was no way that I was going to stay in a Zaandam hotel - I have done that before!!! The Crowne Plaza is ideally situated for ease of access to the station in Amsterdam and proved to be a convenient pied a terre.
I did not spend much time in the hotel but everything worked fine (except the only easily accessible power-point in the bedroom that didn't)! Breakfast was fine but betrayed the hotel's US heritage. Nothing wrong with that!
Staff were friendly and helpful and I found two excellent watering holes nearby - t'Arendsnest on Herrengracht and De Wildeman, just a stone's throw away from the hotel in the pedestrianised area. Both highly recommended for beer lovers.
The gym? It was fine...but it wasn't the one that I remembered...turns out that one was at The Renaissance just around the corner. I had remembered the wrong hotel (but I will return to The Crowne Plaza).
