 Our family of 5 was very excited to stay in what we thought would be an interesting hotel and came home with bed bugs! My husband was covered with bites from head to toe and our daughters had bites on their legs. And we apparently brought them home with us. I contacted the hotel and they don't care and are letting other people sleep here. Stay away people! I don't want you to go through what our family went through. We paid a lot of money to stay in this hotel and ended up with bedbugs!
