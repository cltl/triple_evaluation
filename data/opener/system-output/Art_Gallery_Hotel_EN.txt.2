 The twin room I got was a bit larger than another hotel that I stayed at in Amsterdam. It's alright for two people without a lot of luggage (two medium-sized suitcases). There's no elevator and the steps on the staircases are tall. So it's difficult for older people to climb up and down and to drag luggage if the room is on an upper floor.The bathroom is badly designed as there's no shower base / basin. A curtain just wraps around the shower corner. The water easily spills out of the curtain and all over the floor tiles, making the floor slippery and dangerous for the guests and hard for the custodians to clean. And it's a waste of overusing towels to dry the floor. The custodians didn't follow the rule of picking up the used towels on the floor only, as our still usable towers that were hung on the racks and chairs were taken away too. What a waste of water and bad for the environment. The mirror is also too high above the sink.All the front desk staff was nice and friendly, except for this Turkish guy.  he full-length mirror by the door was taken out when we arrived. There's no light bulb in the desk lamp. One of the light bulbs was out in the bathroom too. I reported all of these to the the Turkish guy, who works the night shifts. He said that we had a problem every day. Once I asked him for Dutch restaurant recommendations and he corrected me by saying that "Dutch" is a language, not an adjective for the people or the culinary style. I was like, WTF? It IS an adjective to describe the culture and people who live in the Netherlands. And yes I know it's derived from Deutsch. But are you freaking kidding me, correcting guests like that? All tour books use the term, "Dutch cuisine." I really think the hotel management needs to fire this arrogant and unfriendly guy. I had to start a fight with him by being firm in telling him that the missing and broken light bulbs and mirrors were not "problems," and stop giving me the attitude. Thee are basic amenities and I simply told him that these were missing items in te hotel room. There are several other incidents with this Turkish guy. He's totally ruining the reputation of the friendly staff and a bad rat in this hotel. He needs to be let go. Period.The location was ok, walkable to major tram and bus stops and near the museum quarters. The environment is quiet at night. The breakfast (we only ate there once) was fine too. It's half priced if you book the room on the hotel's official website. However, I would not stay in this hotel again and obviously do not recommend it.
