 Do not stay in this hotel if you are looking for luxury in Amsterdam, its averagely priced and is located very close to most activity in Amsterdam, the staff are friendly, but the rooms are not prpoerly taken care of. I will recommend this hotel for someone who wants to be close but not too close to Amsterdam city life.
