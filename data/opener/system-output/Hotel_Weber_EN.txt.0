 Great location in Leidseplein with multiple tram lines less than 5 minutes away. Simple yet superb! If you don't want something slightly eccentric, try your luck elsewhere....climb the steep stairs to your slumber celebration. This is a boutique hotel with just eight rooms but you will likely get individual attention (thank you Willem!) upon arrival. Breakfast is included in the price and is served in a small fridge inside your room with assorted meats, cheese, liverwurst, cereal, fresh bread, canned orange juice and spreads. Fresh baked bread is left in the morning on a shelf outside your room for you to enjoy at your leisure. Inside the room is a help yourself teapot along with a Keurig style coffee machine. The bathroom is simple and spacious. The shower is separated from the toilet with a curtain and you'll find a large sink and huge counter top with space available for any and all toiletries....of which shampoo, bar soap and bath gel are provided. It's not a 5 star hotel, but you're not paying a 5 star price, and Dana D's review notwithstanding, this hotel has been open for more than 6 years and my wife and I have stayed here multiple times during that time and we keep coming back....It's true, no AC but a fan is always available to help mitigate any mid-summer heat wave while you're visiting the city. PS-If you want to enjoy an excellent meal try Casa Peru just a couple of blocks away, open late and always good food, not cheap but worth the extra dinero....
