 Has a great location - it is situated in walking distance to the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh museum, stedelijk museum of modern art and near great tram links to all over Amsterdam. The main lobby of Vondel looks great - really meets your expectations of a Boutique hotel but that's where it stops. Check in was rather slow, I don't understand why they didn't have more than one person on the desk, and after paying 20 euros a night to upgrade our room I was a bit disappointed - I would hate to think what the size of a normal twin room was, as our executive room was rather cramped! The decor in the room was obviously hotel boutique 3 years ago, but the up keep seemed to have failed as the sleek gloss black skirting boards were beginning to chip, my bed sheets had hole in it and everything seemed a little tired. The bathroom looked great, but the shower was a bit broken - took me about 20mintues to get it working! The hotel guest book in the room (suggesting where to go, how to get around, attractions) was terrible, hadn't been updated since 2009 and wasn't very helpful at all. Also I couldn't believe you had to pay 10Euros a night for wi-fi, something I would expect from a 3 star hotel but not a 4 star .
