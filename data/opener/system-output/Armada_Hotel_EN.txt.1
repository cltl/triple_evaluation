 The staff were pleasant and on hand whenever needed, giving help and advice for all aspects of our stay. The room was adequate in size for our 2 night stay and very clean.The location was perfect with the tram stop on the doorstep, and only a short walk to the popular Rembrandtsplein. Plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants. Would certainly stay at Armada again. Many thanks
