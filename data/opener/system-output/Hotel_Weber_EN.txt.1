 I stay in Amsterdam multiple times a year and this is by far the best hotel I have stayed in. I loved having refrigerated breakfast foods (juice, milk, meat, cheese) delivered the day before and then waking up to a bread basket every morning. There's free wireless, very comfortable beds, really cool decor (very big, high-ceilings, hard wood floors), and one of the hippest bars in town right downstairs. It's a bit loud at night so I'd recommend asking for a rear room. The staff is also very accommodating to early arrivals.
