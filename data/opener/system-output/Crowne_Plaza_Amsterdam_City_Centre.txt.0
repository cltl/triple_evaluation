 Spent 1 night here after a Baltic cruise. Great location within easy walking distance from the central train station and ship port. Clean, modern, comfortable room with comfy bed and a bath tub (nice for after the cruise). No free wifi, and breakfast will cost you 25 euro per person! We were with our older children (17 & 22), so we walked a block to a little restaurant for an amazing breakfast for 27 euro for all 4! The Italian restaurant across the street is really quite good. 
You may easily walk to many of the popular sites from the hotel, and a canal cruise is just a block away. If you're considering a canal cruise, I wish we would have done the "hop-on-hop-off" canal cruise instead of just the 1-hour cruise, so I recommend that one for just a bit more euro. Bike rentals are close by, too, which I highly recommend, but be careful of the other bike traffic and other tourists who are unaware of the bikes. Over all, a nice stay, but nothing exceptional.
