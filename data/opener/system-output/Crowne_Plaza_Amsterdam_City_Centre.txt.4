I was told I was in a newly renovated room - I'm not sure how recently - but the decor was very pretty, the bed extremely comfortable, and the room was overall an excellent place to return after a day of work (and often, keep working). The location is a convenient short walk to Centraal station, the red light district, and some decent food options. My experience with room service was not very good and the food was pretty poor. The restaurant in the hotel isn't great but was a good option after a long day. The bathroom was a tad cramped but had a good sized tub and excellent water pressure. I didn't use (or see) the fitness room but if/when I return for work, I'm glad to know they have one.
My biggest complaint, I found the 20+ Euros per day charge for internet really ridiculous, and the business center computers were slow - and another guest advised that they quit out mid-task very often. 
The staff was friendly and overall this will be my "go to" hotel when I'm there on business again. It was very corporate/chain feeling hotel though, if you don't like that ambiance. For the amenities and the friendly staff, I definitely would recommend.
