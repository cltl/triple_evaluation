 I stayed in NH carlton when its name was Jolly Carlton Hotel in 1997.
Now again, I Stayed in NH Carlton Amsterdam to get close to flower market as its location is attached to the flower market. No Bell boy helped me take our luggages to my room on the 6th floor, I brought 4 big luggages. I has an executive room, The bed (mattres) was not comfortable at all, after spending 3 nights in NH carlton, every morning I woke up with the backache. they might have been using the old mattres. The air conditioner was not working well, it was hot in the room. The location is perfect, surrounded by restaurant, cafe, supermarket, tram stop, kalverstraat etc. The wifi was free, the acces code was provided freely on the desk in the lobby are, everyone can easily take one, but the speed was slow.
